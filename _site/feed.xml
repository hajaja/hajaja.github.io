&lt;p&gt;Although not a securet for a long time, following market move has been profitable in the past century&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X11002613&quot;&gt;Moskowitz2011&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The strategy is tested on all the products trading in the three Commodity Future Markets in China, including SHFE, DCE, CZCE, between Jan 1st 2005 and Aug 1st 2017. Trading cost is set at 3%% either for buy or sell, and the leverage is 250%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once entering the market, the position will be held for a period, which means there is a period (between a week to several months, depending on the strategy parameters) when no trade happens (this strategy is different from the conventionalstrategies like DualThurst, RBreak). The final performance of the strategy is affected by the starting date of test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no perfect solution on this, some statistical features are found to mitigate such dependeces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution is to divide all the positions into N divisions (N is the days to hold the position), and adjust position every day on one division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunatelly, this simple Time Series Momentum strategy brings lower return and higher volatility recently. This can be partially attributed to the popularity of automatic trading in recent years. Simplly following the market may be a risky behavior in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Time Series Momentum More academic resources can be found here</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Smart Carry Strategy (Commodity Future)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Smart-Carry/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Smart Carry Strategy (Commodity Future)" /><published>2017-08-27T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-08-27T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Smart-Carry</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Smart-Carry/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;carry-strategy&quot;&gt;Carry Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A currency carry trade is a strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a relatively low interest rate and uses the funds to purchase a different currency yielding a higher interest rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there is no interest in a commodity future contract, the discout rate plays the role. A commodity contract that is now traded at discount (with high discount rate), is equivalent with a currency with high interest rate. Assuming the the price of actuals is stable, then the price of the commodity future traded at discount rate will converge to that of the actual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are times when a contract is traded at discount, while this product (including the dominant contract) is dropping. The momentum of the contract price affects the decision to follow the smart carry strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Carry Strategy A currency carry trade is a strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a relatively low interest rate and uses the funds to purchase a different currency yielding a higher interest rate.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Adaptive Filter Strategy (Commodity Future)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/Adaptive-Filter-Strategy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Adaptive Filter Strategy (Commodity Future)" /><published>2017-08-27T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2017-08-27T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Adaptive-Filter-Strategy</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Adaptive-Filter-Strategy/">&lt;h1 id=&quot;trend-from-a-frequency-domain-perspective&quot;&gt;Trend from a Frequency Domain Perspective&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 day Moving Average is equivalent with a low pass fitler with coefficients b = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] and a = 1. 
The volatility is relatively high frequency (from day to day change), when compared with the price move on a 5 day range. The trend is mostly hidden in the low-frequency area in the frequency domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the efforts to recognize the trend of price movement is actually searching for the informative low frequency components in the frequency domain. Shedding the communicaition techniques on the strategy field, we can leverage the mature filter design on our tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us use the 5 day Moving Average line again. The average price we found on Day 5 is actually corresponding to the trend of the 3 day, the 2 day latency is the obastacle of using the filter techniques. However, we can never know the real trend on Day 5, because it is relying on the Day 3, Day 4, Day 5, Day 6 (Future), Day 7(Future) data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Trend from a Frequency Domain Perspective 5 day Moving Average is equivalent with a low pass fitler with coefficients b = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] and a = 1.
